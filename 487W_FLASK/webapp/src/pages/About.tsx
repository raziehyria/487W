      <h3>Course Scheduling Application: Version 1.2</h3>
      <div className="ms-3">
        <p>
          This application is developed as part of the "CMPSC 487W: Software
          Engineering" course at the Pennsylvania State University - Abington.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new version 1.2 is also developed as part of the "CMPSC 487W":
          Software Engineering" course final project on the request of Prof.
          Ishti. This new version turned the application into web based, and
          optimized the genetic algorithm to generate schedules faster
        </p>
        <p>
          Special thanks to Prof. Zafer Hatahet, Division Head, Science and
          Engineering for his valuable input and feedback. It is inspired by the
          "Genetic Algorithms Class Scheduling w/ Python Tutorial" available at
          YouTube: https://youtu.be/8NrNX_jCkjw
